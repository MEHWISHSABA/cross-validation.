Respected Sir, 
I m trying the same code of customer churn but in cross validation section is gives an error .i m sending python code with error message .plz sort out my problem
that's the code;

from sklearn.cross_validation import KFold

def run_cv(X,y,clf_class,**kwargs):
    # Construct a kfolds object
    kf = KFold(len(y),n_folds=5,shuffle=True)
    y_pred = y.copy()
    
    # Iterate through folds
    for train_index, test_index in kf:
        X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]
        y_train = y[train_index]
        # Initialize a classifier with key word arguments
        clf = clf_class(**kwargs)
        clf.fit(X_train,y_train)
        y_pred[test_index] = clf.predict(X_test)
    return y_pred

It gives this error please solve this issue and guide me how to solve it
